                                   Project 5: Hash Map

Charles Wallace Jeffries


At this time, the code has only been tested and designed to work with string inputs. 
There is a main method for the HashMap.Java class, however it was commented out. It has a few self-made test cases. This program was written in IntelliJ IDEA. 

The code can also be run from the terminal line. If you would like to use a .txt file of your own to test the code's functionality (I have also provided 3 .txt files), you can use the TextScan.java class. If using the TextScan.java class, you must compile and run through the command line.


Best,
Charlie J.
